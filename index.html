    <p><b>How the Internet works</b></p>
<p>Accessing a web page, such as Expedia.com, results in a <b>HTTP request</b>sent to <b>servers</b> for page information. 
Page information on the server is stored as an <b>HTML document</b>. 
When HTML is sent back to users computer, the <b>web browser</b> displays information in a readable format</p
<br>
<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b></p>
<p> HTML includes TEXT (“what you see”) and MARKUP (“how it looks”). 
HTML documents are made up of:</p>
<p>1.  Text Content – What you see</p>
<p>2.  Markup  - What it looks like</p>
<p>3.  References to other documents</p>
<p>4.  Links to other pages</p>
<br>
<p><b>HTML Tags and Elements</b></p>
<p>HTML is made up of HTML tags and elements.
Tags will typically have an opening tag and a closing tag.
If elements have no content, then no closing tag is needed (“void tag”). 
Elements are made up of inline or block elements. 
Block elements create an invisible block of content.</p>
<p>Basic HTML tags include:</p>
<p>b = bold</p>
<p>a = links</p>
<p>img = Image</p>
<p>br = break</p>
<p>p = paragraph</p>
